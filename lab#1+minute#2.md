    What are two ethical considerations when dealing with data?
    Dealing with data raise a number of legal and privacy questions, such as who gets to access private and 
    confidential data, 
    and the storing of private data for marketing purposes by large tech companies. 
    Handling of public and government data by private companies is a huge ongoing issue in Europe right now, 
    where the European Union is investigating the limit the reaches of companies like Google and Facebook.
